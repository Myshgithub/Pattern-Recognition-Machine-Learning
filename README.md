# Pattern-Recognition-Machine-Learning:
The goal is to try and test some Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning Algorithms Plus some implementations with Tensorflow

This Pattern Recognition Course, Offered by Prof. Cheehung Henry Chu in Spring 2019 with the following syllabus:
(CSCE_509/lecture Slides 01.pdf,02,04,06)

However, later I searched more and reviewed some other complimentary materials that I would like to list them here as well:
