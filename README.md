# Pattern-Recognition-Machine-Learning:
The goal is to try and test some Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning Algorithms Plus some implementations with Tensorflow

This Pattern Recognition Course, Offered by Prof. Cheehung Henry Chu in Spring 2019 with the following syllabus:
(CSCE_509/lecture Slides 01.pdf,02,04,06)

However, later I searched more and reviewed some other complimentary materials that I would like to list them here as well:
A very close syllabus to what we covered in our class has been offered at university of Waterloo by Prof. Ali Ghodsi. 
It's tiltle is: Statistical Learning- Classification
All Slides and videos are available in the following link:
